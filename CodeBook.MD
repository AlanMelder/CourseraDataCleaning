In order to create a tidy dataset, the run_analysis.R script performs the following steps. These are also annoted in the script file.

1) Merging the training and data files
2) Selecting the Subject ID and Activity columns and columns that contain mean or standard deviation values.
3) Cleaning up column names for improved legibility
4) Changing values in Activity column to descriptive labels
